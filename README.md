## Beginner_python_test
This is just a tiny repo where I will put a simple Hello_world.py script with alot of other things as I continue learning Python, since C is too complicated for me right now

# Archived
I am now on Rust and trying to learn it. So this repo is now archived as I have nothing new to bring here.
